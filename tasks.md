1. add funcitonality to the input form to update the data for a location already in the table
2. make a new page that is a public facing order form that you can order salmon cookies and swag. That form would need to receive all of the things you'd expect on an order form: name, address, payment info, products to order, quantities, special instructions, and so on.
3. A second 'private' page (**order-processing.html**) that shows a list of pending orders and the individual order details. The business owner can then process the orders by clicking a button next to the order that then moves that list item to a 'Filled Orders' list at the bottom of the page.
4. Make a style guide, using [this one that a team Brian was on made for Everlast](http://everlast.com/style-guide) as a model.
5. add a button to swap the color of the website on click
